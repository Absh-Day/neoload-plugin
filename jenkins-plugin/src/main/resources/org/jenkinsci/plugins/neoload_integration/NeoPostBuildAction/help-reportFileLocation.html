<div>
  This is the directory location of the xml test results file that was created by this job. 
  This setting must match the output directory specified when NeoLoad is launched.
  <br/>For trend graphs to be used the directory must include xml results.
  <br/>
  <br/>For a link from within Jenkins to the html results the directory must include html results and 
  	the html results must be archived as an artifact by Jenkins. Note that all html files including 
  	directories and images must be archived. In the post-build action for example, specifying a directory 
  	such as "neoload-report\*.*" will not include subdirectories while "neoload-report\**" will include 
  	subdirectories.

  Example: ${workspace}\neotys-report
